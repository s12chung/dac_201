<p>I'm Steven Chung, a Computer Science and Geography student at the University of Waterloo.
    To be honest, this website is an assignment for my design course, <a href="http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/0910/COURSE/course-DAC.html#DAC200S">DAC 201</a>.
It's supposed to be a module to teach something about design.</p>

<p>The class used <a href="http://www.articulate.com/products/engage.php">Articulate Engage</a> to build their modules, but I disliked the software.
The software was buggy and I felt that I was fighting against the medium make it do what I wanted it to do.
So I built my website from scratch in two days. Never done it before, but I learned quite a bit.
I used my <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> knowledge I learned from my co-op at <a href="http://xtremelabs.com/">Xtreme Labs</a> to speed things up.
I'm happy I put in the extra work (during my exam study period). Hope you like the website as much as I do.

<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
