<p>Most people associate typography with fonts. This page will go through some basics of web fonts.</p>

<h3>Serifs</h3>
<p>Before going into the various types of fonts, you should understand that most 
fonts generally fall under two categories, serif and sans-serif.</p>

<ul>
	<li ><strong>Serif </strong>fonts have non-structural details at the ends of
	strokes on some letters called serifs (highlighted in red below)</li>

	<li><strong>Sans-serif</strong> fonts don&#39;t have serifs (&quot;sans-serif&quot; literally 
	means &quot;without serif&quot; in French)</li>
</ul>

<p>Serif fonts are easier to read because the serifs help the words flow and
distinguish characters. They have been very popular with 
print copy. On the other hand, sans-serif fonts are more popular on computers because low resolution screens and
slow computers make it difficult to show the serifs and  thinner strokes, especially for small font sizes.
However, with faster computers, serif fonts are being more widely used in the body.
In terms of style, serif fonts look more traditional, while san-serif
fonts are clean and modern.</p>

<p>As a general rule, when using more than one font, use two fonts,
one serif and one sans-serif</strong> (unless you&#39;re a 
designer) because it is often difficult to tell the difference between two of 
the same type of fonts. Also, it&#39;s common to see the less readable font as a 
header and the more readable font as the body because of the different font 
sizes.</p>

<p>Statistically, 60% of web sites use sans-serif fonts for headlines, and 66%
of web sites use sans-serif fonts for the body. Arial, Georgia and Verdana are 
the most popular fonts. See

<h3>Web fonts and font stacks</h3>

<p>Generally, in order for web sites to display a font, the web site viewer must
have the font installed on their computer. Otherwise, the web browser will show 
the default serif or sans-serif font installed.</p>

<p>Sadly, not everyone has all the fonts installed. And different operating
systems (i.e. Mac or Windows) have different pre-installed fonts. For example, 
the 99.71% of Mac computers have Helvetica (which is considered the Apple font), 
compared to the 10% of Windows computers (Arial is considered Windows&#39; 
Helvetica).</p>

<p>To compensate for this problem, web designers create font stacks. A
<strong>font stack</strong> is a prioritized list of fonts that
the browser will go through until it finds a font that is installed in the 
computer and display it.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Need an example? Try this <a href="/engage/font/engage.html" target="_blank">interactive module</a>,
that explains the fonts in the User Experience Magazine (UX Mag) website.
This website will be used as an example for all of the tips.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>Implementing font stacks is simple. Just add the CSS property, <em>font-family</em>.
An example of a font stack is down below:</p>

<code>
body { /* means for all text */ <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: &quot;Meta Serif Bold&quot;, &quot;Lucida Bright&quot;, Cambria, Georgia, serif;
    /* Use quotes for font names longer than one word */<br/>
}
</code>

<p>which means check the computer for Meta Serif Bold and if it&#39;s not installed,
try Lucida Bright, then Cambria, Georgia, and then default serif font. An image of the fonts is shown below. </p>
