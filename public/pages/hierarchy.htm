<p>Having a visual hierarchy allows readers to easily scan the website by
picking out what information is important. Hierarchy groups information, so 
users can remember the information easier.</p>
<p>Use font, size, weight and spacing to emphasize or de-emphasize elements to 
show their relative importance to other text. When selecting these typographic 
attributes, just remember to <strong>consider how the text
stands our relative to other text and the text content&#39;s importance to the user</strong>
(and their situation). This is very important in the design.</p>
<p>The same website,
User Experience Magazine, will be used to demonstrate hierarchy
in this <a href="/engage/hierarchy/engage.html" target="_blank">labelled graphic interaction</a>.</p>
