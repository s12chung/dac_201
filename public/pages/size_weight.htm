<p>The size and weight (or styling) of the text can affect it's impact on the user. This page will go through tips on
how to select the size and weight of your text.</p>

<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Selecting a font size can be very ambiguous. The most popular size for <strong>headlines are between 18 to 20 pixels and 24 to 26 pixels</strong>. 
The <strong>body usually has font sizes of 12 to 14 pixels</strong>.</p>
<p>When choosing a font size, <strong>follow standard scaling</strong>, 
a set of pre-defined sizes, to increase harmony between type. It's kind of like the Fibonacci numbers, its naturally appealing.
You can see all the scaling sizes in the picture below.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>There are two reasons that drive the selection of weight:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Aesthetic</strong>, adding style or to follow composition</li>
	<li><strong>Content</strong>, the content dictates importance or a mood, such as
quotations requiring italicization</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these reasons as a guide, one can use many methods to increase the weight of a font, such as bolding, capitalization 
or a combination of methods.</p>

<p>When selecting a method, remember that <strong>bold is preferred to add weight</strong> because it&#39;s 
clean, noticeable and readable. Underlining adds noise to the design and are 
often associated with links. Italicization can be hard to see. Capitalized 
letters are harder to read because the letters have similar heights and 
look.</p>

<p>Different colors can be used to add or remove weight.
Decreasing the opacity of the text color is often used to de-emphasize text. In fact, most web sites have a 
white background and text color a bit lighter than pure black.</p>
<p>With all these methods however, you should try to <strong>limit combinations and avoid
overusing weighting methods</strong> because overuse makes strong weights look normal, different weighted text
compete against each other and the combinations might look the same. In other words, your text will look messy.
Simplicity is key.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Again, User Expierence Magazine's website will be used to show the implementation of size and weight in this
<a href="/engage/size_weight/engage.html" target="_blank">labelled graphic interaction</a>.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
 <p>To implement font size, simply use the <em>font-size</em>
CSS property, as shown below.</p>

<code>.some_class {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 1em;<br />
}</code>

<p>Weight implementation varies for each method, see the following code for weighting
methods in CSS.</p>

<code>.some_class {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-weight: bold;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-decoration: underline;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-style: italic;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-variant:small-caps;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-transform: uppercase;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: #222222; /* this is dark gray */<br />
}</code>
