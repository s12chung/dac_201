<p>The size and weight (or styling) of the text can change the effectiveness of 
a font.</p>

<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Selecting a font size can be very ambiguous. The most popular size for <strong>headlines is 18 to 20 pixels and 24 to 26 pixels</strong>. 
The <strong>body usually has font sizes of 12 to 14 pixels</strong>.</p>
<p>When choosing a font size, <strong>follow standard scaling</strong>, 
a set of pre-defined sizes, to increase harmony between type. You can see all 
the scaling sizes in the picture below.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>There are two reasons that drive the selection of weight:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Aesthetic</strong>, adding style or follow composition</li>
	<li><strong>Content</strong>, the content dictates importance or mood, such as
quotations</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these reasons as a guide, one can use many ways to increase the weight of a font, bolding, capitalization 
or a combination of methods.</p>

<p><strong>Bolding is preferred over most methods</strong> to add weight because it&#39;s 
clean, noticeable and readable. Underlining adds noise to the design and are 
often associated with links. Italicization can be hard to see. Capitalized 
letters are harder to read because the letters have more similar height and 
look.</p>

<p>Different colors can be used to add or remove weight.
To de-emphasize text, limit the contrast of the text to its 
background without changing the text&#39;s color. In fact, most web sites have a 
white background and text color a bit lighter than pure black.</p>
<p>Try to <strong>limit combinations and avoid
overusing weighting methods</strong>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Again, User Expierence Magazine's website will be used to show implementation of size and weight in this
<a href="/engage/size_weight/engage.html" target="_blank">module</a>.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
 <p>To implement font size, simply use the <i>font-size</i>
CSS property, as shown below.</p>

<code>.some_class {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 1em;<br />
}</code>

<p>Weight implementation varies for each method, see the following code for weighting
methods in CSS.</p>

<code>.some_class {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-weight: bold;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-decoration: underline;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-style: italic;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-variant:small-caps;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-transform: uppercase;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: #222222; /* this is dark gray */<br />
}</code>
