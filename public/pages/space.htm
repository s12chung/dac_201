<p>Whitespace de-clutters type by distinguishing elements into separate groups
creating relationships between elements. Whitespace also makes type more 
readable, as it has been found that adding whitespace can increase comprehension 
by 20%. The layout of text also influences the user satisfaction of the web 
site.</p>

<h3>Measure</h3>
<p>The <strong>Measure</strong> is the width of the body. The 
measure should be about <strong>55 to 85 characters </strong>
in length (including spaces) to make it easier to read. However, most sites have 
a measure from 73 and 90 characters.</p>
<p>Implementing measure in your web site varies upon the situation. However, a 
good guideline is to adopt a grid system to help, such as the
<a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a>.</p>

<h3>Leading</h3>
<p><strong>Leading</strong> is the vertical space between lines of text. It is 
recommended that the leading should be wider than the word spacing. This 
practice makes it easier for the eye to go along the line, instead of down the 
lines.</p>
<p>Statistically, the <strong>average line height to body copy 
font size ratio (line height รท body copy font size) on web sites is 1.48 </strong>
(1.5 is recommended).</p>
<p>The leading should increase proportionally to the measure. Thus, small 
measure, less leading. Wide measure, more leading. The <strong>
average ratio between the measure and leading is 27.8</strong>. However, this 
number is considered fairly large for typographers.</p>
<p>Also note that <strong>the space between paragraphs should 
be about 75% of the line height</strong> for more vertical rhythm.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>To add leading in CSS, use the <em>line-height</em>
property. To change the space between paragraphs, use the <em>margin-top</em> property 
on your <i>p</i> (paragraph) tags. For example:</p>

<code>
p {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line-height: 150%;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-top: 12px; /* assuming the font size is 16px */<br/>
}
</code>
