<p>Here's a quick summary of what was presented.</p>
<h3>Font</h3>
<p>Quick notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are two types of fonts, serif and sans-serif fonts</li>
	<li>Sans-serif fonts are easier to read on the computer</li>
	<li>Fonts need to be installed on the user&#39;s computer to be displayed, so 
	font stacks compensate for this problem</li>
</ul>
<p>To select a font:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s best to stick with two different fonts, one serif and one 
	sans-serif</li>
	<li>Arial, Georgia and Verdana are the most popular fonts</li>
	<li>This <a href="http://www.awayback.com/revised-font-stack/">web page</a> 
	has more recommended font stacks and font pre-installation statistics</li>
	<li>Use implement font stacks, use the <em>font-family</em> CSS property</li>
</ul>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>About size:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Headlines should be about 18 to 26 pixels</li>
	<li>Body copy 12 to 14 pixels</li>
	<li>Use the <em>font-size</em> CSS property</li>
</ul>
<p>And for weight:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bolding is preferred to emphasize</li>
	<li>Limiting opacity is common to de-emphasize text</li>
	<li>Limit combining and avoid overdoing weighting methods</li>
</ul>
<p>The code below is CSS implementation of weight:</p>
<code>.some_class {<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	font-weight: bold;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
text-decoration: underline;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
font-style: italic;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
font-variant:small-caps;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
text-transform: uppercase;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
color: #222222; /* this is dark gray */<br />
}</code>

<h3>Space</h3>
<p>Quick notes about measure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Measure is the width of the body, which should be about 55 to 85 
	characters in length (including spaces)</li>
	<li>Implementation of measure depends on the situation, try following a grid 
	system like the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>And about leading:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Leading is the vertical space between lines of text</li>
	<li>Leading should be wider than word spacing</li>
	<li>The average line height to body copy font ratio should be 1.5</li>
	<li>Use the <em>line-height</em> CSS property to implement leading</li>
</ul>
<p>Other spacing notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The average ratio between measure and leading is 27.8, which is fairly 
	large</li>
	<li>The space between paragraphs is about 75% of line height, and use the 
	<em>top-margin</em> property on p tags to implement this</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
<p>Just remember to consider how text stands out to the whole design and compare 
that to the text content&#39;s importance to the user and their situation.</p>
